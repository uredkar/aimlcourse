Some fees are charged to every user irrespective of usage, while others are charged under specified circumstances.\n","\n","Customers’ leaving credit cards services would lead bank to loss, so the bank wants to analyze the data of customers and identify the customers who will leave their credit card services and reason for same – so that bank could improve upon those areas\n","\n","You as a Data scientist at Thera bank need to come up with a classification model that will help the bank improve its services so that customers do not renounce their credit cards\n","\n","### Data Description\n","\n","* CLIENTNUM: Client number.

Now, this column represents the average of this value for the last 12 months.\n","\n","##### What is the Average utilization Ratio?\n","\n","- The Avg_Utilization_Ratio represents how much of the available credit the customer spent.
